# Nextflow course - Hands-on

The tutorial in this hands-on session shows how to implement a Variant Calling analysis pipeline for RNA-seq data based on GATK best practices and using Nextflow as the pipeline framework.

!!! warning

    The content and pipeline in this course is aimed at teaching Nextflow, not bioinformatics. Software versions are outdated, among other things, so if you want a variant calling Nextflow pipeline for production you should use [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek) or [nf-core/viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon) instead.
