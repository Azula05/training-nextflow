# Nextflow course - Hands-on

This hands-on session shows how to implement a Nextflow Variant Calling analysis pipeline for RNA-seq data that is based on GATK best practices.

!!! warning

    The content and pipeline in this course is aimed at teaching Nextflow, not bioinformatics. Software versions are outdated, among other things, so if you want a variant calling Nextflow pipeline for production you should use [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek), [nf-core/viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon) or [nf-core/rnavar](https://nf-co.re/rnavar) instead.
